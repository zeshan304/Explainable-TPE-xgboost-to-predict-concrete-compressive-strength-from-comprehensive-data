# Research Paper Title

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the research paper titled "Explainable TPE-xgboost to predict concrete compressive strength from concrete compositions, and mechanical and microstructure properties of testing samples".

## Paper Abstract

[Efficient machine learning for predicting concrete compressive strengths (CCS) requires improved data and robust algorithms. Enhancing data perspective, this study investigates extensive concrete data containing 39 important features relating to concrete compositions, and mechanical and microstructure properties of testing samples. Providing model specific improvements, a novel TPE-xgboost is proposed for accurate and confident predictions, augmented by in-depth interpretation of predictions through SHAP analysis. Compared to past research, CCS prediction accuracy is improved for separate investigation on concrete compositions (~2.26%) and testing samples properties (~28.57%), while reasonable accuracy is maintained for the complex and sparse integrated dataset. SHAP analysis reveals key influential factors, including age and water-to-binder ratio in concrete composition, and peak load and height of testing samples, as well as microstructural characteristics such as mean values of global autocorrelation length and its integral range. Useful discussions are provided regarding model optimization, predictive performance, and features dependencies and interactions]
