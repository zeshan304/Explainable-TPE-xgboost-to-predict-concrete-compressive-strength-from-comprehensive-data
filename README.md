# Research Paper Title

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the research paper titled "Explainable TPE-xgboost to predict concrete compressive strength from concrete compositions, and mechanical and microstructure properties of testing samples".

## Paper Abstract

Efficient machine learning for predicting concrete compressive strengths (CCS) requires improved data and robust algorithms. ....!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up the required Python environment, you can use the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository. And to install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Code Structure

The repository contains following four python scripts 

- [`a_df_pdf_working.py`](a_df_pdf_working.py): The code to extract and process the data of mechanical and microstructure properties of testing samples from .pdf format to .csv file
- `utils/`: Directory containing utility functions.
- `data/`: Directory for storing input data.
- `models/`: Directory containing the machine learning models.
- `results/`: Directory where the output results are saved.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the code and any specific commands or scripts that need to be executed.
