# About

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the research paper titled "**Explainable TPE-xgboost to predict concrete compressive strength from concrete compositions, and mechanical and microstructure properties of testing samples**".

## Abstract of Research Paper

Efficient machine learning for predicting concrete compressive strengths (CCS) requires improved data and robust algorithms. ....!

### Prerequisites

To set up the required Python environment, you can use the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository. And to install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
